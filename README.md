# CETM67_ASSIGNMENT_ONE

This GitHub Repository is to show the required documents for CETM67 Software Platforms, Infrastructure & Deployment Assignment One.

This includes:
 - 4 lambda functions in the lambda_functions directory and then in the further corrosponding directories
 - A requirements file showing what is required to build, lint and test the code.

Postman was used to test all the API's and the links for the API calls can be found:
